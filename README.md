Helix-inspired modal editing in Emacs.

## TODO

- Boon as a base layer for modal editing since it has been lovingly crafted to be completely customisable and is simpler than Evil's modal editing implementation.
- Combublate / ts-movement as for any required treesitter _stuff_ that isn't custom (no point repeating work already done).
